## Overview

ðŸ”— GraphQL bindings are **modular building blocks** that allow to embed existing GraphQL APIs into your own GraphQL server. Think about it as turning (parts of) GraphQL APIs into reusable LEGO building blocks. Bindings may be generated in JavaScript, TypeScript, or Flow. 

> The idea of GraphQL bindings is introduced in detail in this blog post: [Reusing & Composing GraphQL APIs with GraphQL Bindings](https://www.prisma.io/blog/reusing-and-composing-graphql-apis-with-graphql-bindings-80a4aa37cff5/)

## Install

```sh
yarn add graphql-binding
```
